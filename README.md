# 1984Game

Literature for Non-Majors


I built this simple game as my final project for a non-coding class. The game is a coordinate based map game themed around the book 1984. There are goodies, baddies, and a final goal. The player is not able to see the map until the game is completed. The code for this is not great, looking back on it with my knowledge now. There are no functions, the whole thing just runs in main(), and it's just not optimized. But I love to code so much that I asked this non-CS professor to let me code for his class. I presented it to my classmates and it was very well recieved. I'm proud of baby programmer me for taking the initiative and following my passions!
